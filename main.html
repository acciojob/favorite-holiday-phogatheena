	<h1>Manali</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Manali is named after the Sanātanī lawgiver Manu (see Manusmriti). The name Manali is regarded as the derivative of Manu-Alaya (transl. 'the abode of Manu').[4] In Hindu cosmology, Manu is believed to have stepped off his ark in Manali to recreate human life after a great flood had deluged the world. The Kullu Valley in which Manali is situated is often referred to as the "Valley of the Gods". An old village in the town has an ancient temple dedicated to the sage Manu.[5]</p>
